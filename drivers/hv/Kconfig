	  Virtual Secure Mode (VSM) is a set of hypervisor capabilities and
	  enlightenments offered to host and guest partitions which enables
	  the creation and management of new security boundaries within
	  operating system software.

	  VSM achieves and maintains isolation through Virtual Trust Levels
	  (VTLs). Virtual Trust Levels are hierarchical, with higher levels
	  being more privileged than lower levels. VTL0 is the least privileged
	  level, and currently only other level supported is VTL2.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here.

	  If unsure, say N.
