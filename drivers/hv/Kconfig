	  Virtual Secure Mode (VSM) is a set of hypervisor capabilities and
	  enlightenments offered to host and guest partitions which enables
	  the creation and management of new security boundaries within
	  operating system software.

	  VSM achieves and maintains isolation through Virtual Trust Levels
	  (VTLs). Virtual Trust Levels are hierarchical, with higher levels
	  being more privileged than lower levels. VTL0 is the least privileged
	  level, and currently only other level supported is VTL2.

	  Select this option to build a Linux kernel to run at a VTL other than
	  the normal VTL0, which currently is only VTL2.  This option
	  initializes the x86 platform for VTL2, and adds the ability to boot
	  secondary CPUs directly into 64-bit context as required for VTLs other
	  than 0.  A kernel built with this option must run at VTL2, and will
	  not run as a normal guest.
